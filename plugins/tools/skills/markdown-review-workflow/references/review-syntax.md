# DZ Markdown Review Syntax Reference

This reference describes the Markdown review syntax used by `dz-review` and the DZ Markdown Review VS Code extension. Use it when an agent or human reviewer needs to annotate Markdown, reply to inline discussions, apply or cancel custom review annotations, or clean resolved review threads.

## Active Conversations

HTML review comments are the default portable form:

```markdown
The generated text stays normal Markdown.

<!--
@agent I chose this wording because it matches the glossary.
@me Can we make this less categorical?
@agent Done. I softened the wording and kept the glossary term.
-->
```

Custom `{?? ??}` discussions are the compact Obsidian-friendly form:

```markdown
The generated text stays normal Markdown. {?? @agent I chose this wording because it matches the glossary. @me Can we make this less categorical? @agent Done. I softened the wording and kept the glossary term. ??}
```

Compact inline discussions are valid for short notes:

```markdown
The generated text {?? @agent Please validate this claim. ??} continues.
```

Conversation markers may carry timestamps:

```markdown
<!--
@agent%2026-06-16T17:35:35+0200 Please validate this claim.
@me%1WzvP91W Confirmed.
@agent%궨눭녇걸 Follow-up noted.
-->
```

The long form is ISO with an offset. Compact timestamps are shorter base62 values; `1WzvP91W` represents `2026-06-16T17:35:35+02:00`. Hangul timestamps are 4-character base2048 values in `U+AC00..U+B3FF`; `궨눭녇걸` also represents `2026-06-16T17:35:35+02:00`. Treat timestamps as part of the role marker metadata. Do not include them in the message body when summarizing or changing the thread.

Agents should use `dz-review agent start [file...]` once before editing, `dz-review agent status [file...]` for progress checks during that session, and `dz-review agent done [file...]` before handoff. Do not rerun `agent start` just to refresh state; use `agent start --force [file...]` only when intentionally replacing the active snapshot. The start command records each file's original or dominant timestamp format and normalizes timestamps to ISO for readability; the done command restores the recorded format when possible. For one-off work outside an agent session, the ordinary timestamp commands remain a manual fallback.

When adding `{??` next to an existing custom review annotation, do not insert a space:

```markdown
{++new wording++}{?? @agent Please validate this addition. ??}
```

Review annotations may carry timestamp metadata without a role:

```markdown
{++%1WzvP91W|new wording++} {--%2026-06-16T17:35:35+0200|obsolete wording--}
```

Do not use `@agent` or `@me` inside annotation metadata. Keep roles for conversation messages only.

## Roles

Use only these durable roles in active conversations:

- `@agent` for the agent's rationale, change summary, or response.
- `@me` for the human's review comment.

If a human wrote a quick bare note, normalize it:

```markdown
{?? @ This seems too strong. ??}
```

becomes:

```markdown
{?? @me This seems too strong. ??}
```

Do not alter the meaning while normalizing.

## Replying To A Thread

Append new messages to the existing block:

```markdown
{?? @agent I added the sentence because it follows the A3 decision. @me It should mention the data constraint too. @agent Done. I added the data constraint and kept the A3 reference. ??}
```

Do not collapse, reorder, or rewrite previous messages while the thread is unresolved. The history matters because it replaces an external review system.

## Changing Text From A Comment

When a human comment asks for a text change:

1. Make the document change.
2. Add a new `@agent` message in the same thread explaining the change.
3. Leave the thread active until the human validates it.

Example:

```markdown
The service stores generated summaries with trace metadata. {?? @me Please say whether source documents are stored too. @agent Done. I clarified that source documents remain in the existing system and only generated summaries plus trace metadata are stored here. ??}
```

## Custom Review Annotations

Use custom review annotations when the proposed change is local and concrete:

```markdown
Addition: {++new text++} Deletion: {--old text--} Replacement: {~~old text~>new text~~} Highlight: {==text to review==} Comment: {>>review note<<} Discussion: {?? @agent Please validate this sentence. ??}
```

Cancelling an annotation means preserving the pre-review text:

- `{++new++}` -> remove the annotation entirely.
- `{--old--}` -> `old`.
- `{==text==}` -> `text`.
- `{>>comment<<}` -> remove the annotation entirely.
- `{~~old~>new~~}` -> `old`.
- `{?? discussion ??}` -> remove the discussion.

Applying an annotation means accepting the proposed result:

- `{++new++}` -> `new`.
- `{--old--}` -> remove the annotation entirely.
- `{==text==}` -> `text`.
- `{>>comment<<}` -> remove the annotation entirely.
- `{~~old~>new~~}` -> `new`.
- `{?? discussion ??}` -> remove the discussion.

## Validation And Cleanup

Treat a trailing human `ok`, `OK`, `@me ok`, or explicit "resolved" message as validation. After validation:

1. Apply or cancel any custom review annotation according to the requested outcome.
2. Remove the active conversation block.
3. Keep a durable comment only when it documents useful rationale, uncertainty, or provenance.

Durable Markdown comment:

```markdown
<!-- Justification: The wording follows the validated glossary term. -->
```

Durable Obsidian comment:

```markdown
%% Justification : The wording follows the validated glossary term. %%
```

Delete review chatter that no longer has documentary value.

## Final Answer Checklist

After working with review syntax, report:

- which files changed;
- which discussions received an `@agent` reply;
- which discussions were cleaned after validation;
- which unresolved discussions remain for the human.
